# Pay and Connect Plus

## About 

At the University of Cape Town, students who live in certain on-campus housing can ask for special vouchers to buy food at the school. They can request these vouchers between 9:00 PM the night before you want them and 9:00 AM on the day you want them.

One problem I have is that I often forget to ask for these vouchers when I need them. To solve this, I use Pay and Connect Plus. It helps me automatically ask for vouchers on the days I want them.
