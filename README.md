# Pay and Connect Plus (ARCHIVED)
**Important: This project has been archived.**


## Project Archived

This project is no longer actively maintained, as I have found a better solution to the problem it was designed to solve. I recommend that you transition to the new solution, which offers improved features and performance.

### Why I am Archiving?


I decided to archive this project because I found a more efficient and reliable way to automate the request of vouchers for food at the University of Cape Town. Instead of using a webdriver with Selenium to interact with the website and solve the reCAPTCHA challenge with Azure Text to Speech, I discovered that I could use the API request that the website sends with my authorization token to issue myself a voucher.
This way, I can avoid the hassle of dealing with reCAPTCHA and reduce the risk of errors or delays in the process. I also save time and resources by using a simpler and faster method. 
Therefore, I no longer need to work on this project and I can archive it for future reference.
